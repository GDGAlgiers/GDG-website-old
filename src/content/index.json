We believe that hacking under such circumstances would give opportunity to some cool ideas that will certainly add value either spiritually or collectively to the society as we’re suggesting to the participants a variety of themes that they can be hacking in.This hackathon is for students, professionals, and programming enthusiasts who want to invest two weeks of their lives in building some cool stuff, that matter.",
